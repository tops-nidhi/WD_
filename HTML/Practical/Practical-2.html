    <h2>Importance of meta tag:</h2>
    <p>
        Meta elements are tags used in HTML and XHTML documents to provide structured metadata about a Web page. They are part of a web page's head section. Multiple Meta elements with different attributes can be used on the same page. Meta elements can be used to specify page description, keywords and any other metadata not provided through the other head elements and attributes.

    <p><b>Attributes:</b>
        <dl>
            <dt>name:</dt>
            <dd>This attribute is used for indicating the character encoding for the HTML Document.</dd>
            <dt>http-equiv:</dt>
            <dd>This attribute is used to get the HTTP response message header.</dd>
            <dt>content:</dt>
            <dd>This attribute is used to specify properties value.</dd>
            <dt>charset:</dt>
            <dd>This is used for indicating the character encoding for the HTML Document.</dd>

    <h2>Importance of Doctypes:</h2>
    <p>
        HTML Doctype is most often written at the very first element of the entire HTML document. It remains wrapped inside angle brackets but it is not a tag. It is a statement or declaration.  Doctype stands for Document Type. It is a statement to declare the type of the document. With the help of this statement, the developer let the browser know that the following document is an HTML document.
    </p>
    <p>
        Technically <!DOCTYPE > is not a tag/element, it just an instruction to the browser about the document type. It is a null element which does not contain the closing tag, and must not include any content within it.
